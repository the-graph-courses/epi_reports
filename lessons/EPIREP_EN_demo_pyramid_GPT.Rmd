# Introducing Demographic Pyramids

‣ **Demographic pyramids** visualize population distribution by **age** and **sex**.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Shape of overall population resembles a **pyramid**, hence the name.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ **Population pyramids** are graphs with age groups on the y-axis and sex on the x-axis.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ `ggplot2` allows us to create and customize these pyramids.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ While `apyramid` package offers quick creation, `ggplot2` provides versatility in customization.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

## Using Population Pyramids in Epidemiology

‣ Pyramids aid in understanding **disease epidemiology** by showing age and sex distribution.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Incidence of diseases like **TB** and **malaria** varies with age and differs by regions.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ This visualization informs **surveillance programs** about which age groups to target.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ **Demographic distribution** also assists in **data quality assessment** for routine surveillance.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Comparing national data with global epidemiology checks for **external consistency**.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

## Conceptualizing Demographic Pyramids

![](images/final_pyramid.png)

‣ **Population pyramid** is essentially two bar graphs merged on the y-axis.

![](images/combined_pyramid.png)

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Below is the female half of the pyramid, with axes flipped:

![](images/female_x_pyramid.png)

‣ By combining both halves, we complete the pyramid.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ The **negative count** for males allows them to appear on the left side of the pyramid.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

# Packages

‣ For this lesson, we require several **R packages**.

‣ These include packages for **file paths**, **data manipulation**, **data cleaning**, and **creating age pyramids**.

```{r}
# Ensure all necessary packages are loaded using pacman
pacman::p_load(here, tidyverse, janitor, apyramid)
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

## Data Preparation

### Intro to the Dataset

‣ We'll be using a **fictional HIV dataset** imitating a linelist of cases in Zimbabwe during 2016.

‣ It's a simulation, with each row representing a patient and columns for different variables, focusing on **demographic** and **HIV-related data**.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

### Importing Data

‣ Our goal is to understand the data for creating a **demographic pyramid**.

‣ We'll concentrate on `age_group` and `sex` variables for our pyramid.

‣ Here's how we import and inspect our dataset:

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r}
# Load the dataset and view the initial few rows
hiv_data <- read_csv(here::here("data/clean/hiv_zimbabwe_2016.csv"))
# Display the dataset structure
hiv_data
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Our dataset has **28000 cases** across **3 columns**: `age_group`, `sex`, and `hiv_status`.

‣ For the pyramid, we'll filter out **HIV positive** cases and ensure factors are set for `age_group` and `hiv_status`.

‣ Let's look at a **cleaned subset** specific to our analysis:

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r}
# Load a subset of the data focusing on HIV prevalence
hiv_prevalence <- readRDS(here::here("data/clean/hiv_zimbabwe_prevalence.rds"))
# Display the subset
hiv_prevalence
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ This subset narrows down to **3923 HIV positive patients**.

‣ Next, we'll create a summary table for `age_group` and `sex`.

‣ We use **`tabyl()`** from the **janitor package** for this.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r}
# Summarize the data into a table by age group and sex
hiv_prevalence %>% 
  tabyl(age_group, sex)
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Ensure data is clean and **age groups are in ascending order** before plotting.

‣ In demographic pyramids, the youngest are at the bottom, oldest at the top.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

**PRACTICE TIME !**

::: practice
**Create a demographic pyramid** using the `apyramid` package with the `hiv_prevalence` data focusing on `age_group` and `sex`. Remember to follow the ascending order for age groups.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Insert code to create the demographic pyramid here:
_____________
```
:::

## Packages

‣ This lesson requires specific **R packages** to be installed and loaded: **`here`**, **`tidyverse`**, **`janitor`**, and **`apyramid`**

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r}
# Ensure all required packages are loaded using pacman
p_load(
  ___________,       # to locate files
  ___________,  # to clean, wrangle, and plot data (includes ggplot2 )
  ___________,    # tables and cleaning data
  ___________)   # package dedicated to creating age pyramids
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

## Data Preparation

### Intro to the Dataset

‣ We're working with a **fictional HIV dataset** mimicking HIV cases in Zimbabwe during 2016.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ The dataset simulates a **linelist**, with each row representing a patient and columns for various demographic and HIV-related variables.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Our focus: **age-related** and **sex** variables for a demographic pyramid.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

### Importing Data

‣ First, we'll import our data to RStudio, concentrating on `age_group` and `sex` for the pyramid.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r load_data}
______________ <- read_csv(here::here("data/clean/hiv_zimbabwe_2016.csv"))
# Examine the data structure
______________
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Our dataset: **28000 rows** and **3 columns** - `age_group`, `sex`, and `hiv_status`.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Goal: Demographic pyramid on HIV **prevalence** - filter for **HIV positive** patients.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r hiv_prevalence}
# Loading the cleaned data subset
______________ <- readRDS(here::here("data/clean/hiv_zimbabwe_prevalence.rds"))
# Display the cleaned data subset
______________
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Filtered subset: **3923 rows**, with patients all **HIV positive**.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

### Data Inspection

‣ Let's summarize `age_group` and `sex` using a table with `tabyl()` from **`janitor`**.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r summary_table}
# Create a summary table
______________ %>% 
  ____________(________________, ______________)
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Ensure data is in **ascending order** - crucial for plotting the demographic pyramid correctly.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Youngest age group should be at the **bottom** of the pyramid, oldest at the **top**.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

::: pro-tip
Always verify your data's order before plotting a demographic pyramid!

![](images/white_square.jpg)

## Creating Aggregated Data Subset

‣ We're going to aggregate data by age group and sex.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ The goal is a table where *male* values are negative (for left-side plotting).

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Understanding `geom_col` is key for plotting.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Aggregated data is essential for categorical levels in demographic pyramids.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ We will calculate counts and percentages per group.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Female values positive, male values negative.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Remember: Negate male *y values* for left side plotting!

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r}
# Create new subset
______________ <- 
  hiv_prevalence %>% 
  count(______________, 
        ______________,
        name = "total") %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(
    counts = case_when(
      sex == "female" ~ total,
      sex == "male" ~ -total, # Convert male to negative
      TRUE ~ NA_real_
    ),
    percent = round(100 * (total / sum(total, na.rm = TRUE)), digits = 1),
    percent = case_when(
      sex == "female" ~ percent,
      sex == "male" ~ -percent, # Convert male to negative
      TRUE ~ NA_real_
    )
  )
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

**TIME TO PRACTICE**

‣ When creating male bar plot, how are the occurrence values modified?

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Multiple-choice question for understanding
# When creating the male bar plot, what modification is made to the occurrence values?

# a. They are added to the x-axis values.
# b. They are multiplied by 2.
# c. They are divided by 2.
# d. They are negated (multiplied by -1).
```

## V2 **Creating Aggregated Data Subset**

‣ To plot a demographic pyramid, we need an aggregated data subset with occurrences per age group and sex.

‣ Important: for **`geom_col`** in ggplot2, specify the count for each group in **`aes`** as either the x or y variable.

‣ The dataset should have aggregated counts or percentages per age group and sex.

‣ Female values will be positive, and male values will be negative in our subset to display on opposite sides of the pyramid.

```{r}
# Create new subset
________________ <- 
  hiv_prevalence %>% 
  _________________________________________________________________________
  _________________________________________________________________________
  _________________________________________________________________________
  _________________________________________________________________________
  _________________________________________________________________________
  _________________________________________________________________________

```

## Creating Aggregated Data Subset

‣ We will create an aggregated data subset for the demographic pyramid

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Aggregated by total occurrences per age group and sex

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Note: Male values will be negative for left side placement on the graph

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r count_occurences}
# Create new subset with total counts and percentages per age group and sex
______________ <- 
  hiv_prevalence %>% 
  count(______________________) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(
    counts = case_when(
      sex == "________" ~ ________,
      sex == "________" ~ -total, # convert male to negative
      TRUE ~ NA_real_
    ),
    percent = round(100 * (total / sum(total, na.rm = TRUE)), digits = 1),
    percent = case_when(
      sex == "________" ~ ________,
      sex == "________" ~ -percent, # convert male to negative
      TRUE ~ NA_real_
    )
  )

______________
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Remember to negate the male `y` value for correct graph representation

![](images/white_square.jpg)

**CHECK YOUR UNDERSTANDING**

‣ Let's see if you understand the modifications done for male data points

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Choose the correct answer for what happens to male occurrence values in the pyramid:

```         
‣ a. Added to the x-axis values
‣ b. Multiplied by 2
‣ c. Divided by 2
‣ d. Negated (multiplied by -1)
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

## Plot Creation

‣ We're going to create a demographic pyramid with a bar graph

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Using the `age_group` categorical variable for plotting

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ `sex` will be used to fill the graph colors

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r geom_col}
demo_pyramid <- 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(data = ____________,
           mapping = aes(x = ____________,
                         y = ____________,
                         fill = ____________),
           colour = "white") +
  coord_flip()

demo_pyramid
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Notice we're plotting data directly in `geom_col()` for layer flexibility

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ We can also use percentage values on the y-axis

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r geom_col_percent}
demo_pyramid_percent <- 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(data = ____________,
           mapping = aes(x = ____________,
                         y = ____________,
                         fill = ____________),
           colour = "white") +
  coord_flip()

demo_pyramid_percent
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ For already aggregated data, we can use `geom_bar` with `stat = "identity"`

![](images/white_square.jpg)

**PRACTICE QUESTIONS**

‣ What type of variable should be used for `x` in `geom_col`?

```         
‣ a. Continuous variables
‣ b. Categorical variables
‣ c. Binary variables
‣ d. Ordinal variables
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Which function flips the axes?

```         
‣ a. coord_flip()
‣ b. x_y_flip()
‣ c. geom_histogram_flip()
‣ d. All of the above
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Where do you pass `stat = "identity"` for a bar plot?

```         
‣ a. geom_col
‣ b. geom_histogram
‣ c. geom_bar
‣ d. All of the above
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Create a pyramid with `geom_col` for Zimbabwe's 2016 population data

```{r coding_question4, eval=FALSE}
# Replace the placeholders with the correct variable names and values:
Q4_pyramid_zw_2016 <- 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(data = ____________,
           aes(x = ____________,
               y = ____________,
               fill = ____________),
           color = "white") +
  coord_flip()
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

## Plot Customization

‣ Customize your demographic pyramid for clarity and information

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Add titles, axes labels, and captions for informativeness

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r adjusting_labels}
adjusted_labels <- 
  demo_pyramid +
  labs(
    title = "________ and Sex of Cases",
    x = "________ Group",
    y = "________ of Total",
    caption =

 "Data are from linelist \nn = ________ (age or sex missing for ________ cases)")
adjusted_labels
```

## Axis Adjustments

‣ Proper visualization of data often requires **adjusting scales**.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ We'll start by rescaling the *y-axis* to ensure **symmetry** in the demographic pyramid.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ This involves identifying **maximum** and **minimum** values from our `pyramid_data`.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r}
# Save max and min total counts as objects
max_count <- _____________(pyramid_data$counts, na.rm = T)
min_count <- _____________(pyramid_data$counts, na.rm = T)
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Our goal is a y-axis that is symmetrical around zero.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ We will use the larger of the absolute values of max and min counts to set y-axis limits.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r}
# Use previous graph
adjusted_axes <- adjusted_labels +
  scale_y_continuous(
    # Set limits to the larger absolute value for symmetry
    limits = c(__________ * c(-1,1)),
    # Define breaks based on the new limits
    breaks = seq(-400, 400, 400/5),
    # Use absolute values for axis labels for clarity
    labels = abs)
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

## Enhancing the Graph's Appearance

‣ The **aesthetic appeal** of a graph is crucial for **engagement** and **clarity**.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Adjusting the **color scheme** and **theme** can greatly enhance interpretability.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ Let's apply some style adjustments to our demographic pyramid.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

```{r}
# Build upon the adjusted axes
adjusted_color_theme <- 
  adjusted_axes +
  # Specify colors for each category
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("female" = "__________",
               "male" = "__________"),
    # Label the legend appropriately
    labels = c("____________", 
               "____________")) +
  # Fine-tune theme elements for a cleaner look
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_line(colour = "__________"),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 11, face = "__________"))

adjusted_color_theme
```

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ You can now take these concepts to visualize **cases against baseline populations** or the **impact of health interventions**.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ This knowledge is invaluable for **epidemiological analysis** and reporting.

![](images/white_square.jpg)

‣ **Congratulations** on completing this lesson! Your new skills are ready for real-world application.
