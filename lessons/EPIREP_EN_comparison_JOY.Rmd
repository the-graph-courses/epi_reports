## Introduction

Welcome to this lesson on group comparisons in data visualization. This is an important topic in data analysis, as it allows us to understand differences and similarities in our data across different segments or groups.

In this lesson, we'll explore a variety of visualization techniques. We'll discuss bar plots for showing frequency among categories, box plots for illustrating data distribution, and we'll touch on error bars and density plots for demonstrating data variability and distribution.

By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use these tools to visualize and compare groups in your data, enhancing your ability to draw meaningful insights from your datasets. Let's get started.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1.  Distinguish between bar plots, column plots, and histograms.
2.  Visualize different summary metrics among different categories and groups.
3.  Implement box plots to illustrate data distribution across various groups.
4.  Apply error bars to represent data variability.

## Packages

For this lesson we will use the {tidyverse} package

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, here)
```

## Data

The data for this lesson comes from Benin (tbd)


```{r}
tb_benin <- read_csv(here("data/raw/tbhistoric_benin/BEN long format 2011 - 2017.csv"))
```

```{r warning=FALSE}
tb_benin_mini <- tb_benin %>%
  filter(str_detect(variable_name, 'newrel_clin|newrel_lab'),
         str_detect(period, '2017'))
```


```{r warning=FALSE}

quart_totals <- tb_benin_mini %>% group_by(period, variable_name) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(value))
quart_totals

wide_totals <- quart_totals %>% pivot_wider(names_from = variable_name,
                             values_from = total)
```

Next I want to make it longer again so we end up with these columns:
- period: self explantory
- dx_method: factor with 2 levels (clinical, bateriological)
- status: factor with 7 levels (coh, cured, completed, failed, died, lost, unavailable)

```{r}
# More pivoting...

```


## Understanding Barplots, Histograms, and Col Plots

In data visualization, the choice of plot type depends on the data and the goal of the analysis. Barplots, histograms, and col plots each have their unique applications. For instance, a barplot is perfect for comparing a numerical and categorical variable. In R, this can be achieved using the `geom_bar()` function from the `ggplot2` package. For example:

```{r}
# Barplot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

Histograms, on the other hand, are best for showcasing the distribution of a single numerical variable. Using `geom_histogram()`, we can easily create histograms:

```{r}
# Histogram
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

Col plots, or column plots, are used to compare multiple numerical variables. These can be created using the `geom_col()` function:

```{r}
# Col Plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_col()
```

## Diving Deeper into Barplots: Stacked and Grouped Barplots

Building on the concept of barplots, we can further distinguish between stacked and grouped barplots. Stacked barplots are incredibly useful when you want to show total counts across categories, with the contribution of each subgroup. This can be done by setting `position = "stack"` in `geom_bar()`.

```{r}
# Stacked Barplot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), fill = factor(vs))) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack")
```

On the other hand, grouped barplots are more effective when comparing subgroups across multiple categories. This can be done by setting `position = "dodge"` in `geom_bar()`.

```{r}
# Grouped Barplot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), fill = factor(vs))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

## Enhancing Barplots: Adding Error Bars

Going a step further with barplots, we can add error bars as a graphical representation of data variability. This is a critical aspect, especially in scientific research where it's important to represent the degree of uncertainty or variability in the data.

```{r}
# Calculate standard errors
mtcars_summary <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg), se_mpg = sd(mpg) / sqrt(n()), .groups = "drop")

# Barplot with Error Bars
ggplot(mtcars_summary, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mean_mpg)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_mpg - se_mpg, ymax = mean_mpg + se_mpg), width = 0.2)
```

## Exploring New Forms: Geom_ribbon and Area Plots

Moving beyond barplots, let's explore `geom_ribbon()` and area plots. These types of plots are particularly useful when visualizing a range of values or a progression of data over time, such as stock prices or temperature changes.

```{r}
# Area Plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_area(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue")

# Ribbon Plot
ggplot(mtcars_summary, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mean_mpg)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = mean_mpg - se_mpg, ymax = mean_mpg + se_mpg), alpha = 0.5)
```

## Venturing into Circular Plots: Pie Charts and Donut Plots

Lastly, let's delve into pie charts and donut plots. While these types of plots can be visually appealing, they should be used sparingly due to their potential to mislead. They are most effective when comparing parts of a whole for a single category, and when there are few categories to compare.

```{r}
# Pie Chart
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = "", fill = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0)

# Donut Plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = "", fill = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  theme_void() +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = -1, xmax = 1, ymin = -1, ymax = 1), fill = "white")
```
